# Project Objective

This project aims to develop the 1) **binary and multi-class sentiment analysis** and 2) **Movie Recommendation system**.

This readme first goes through the sentiment analysis part, followed by discussion on recommendation system in the second part.

# Binary and Multi-class Sentiment Analysis System

For sentiment analysis modeling, we have developed three deep NLP based models, as follows:

<ul>
<li>
    
 </li>
</ul>
